# SecureBank: Enhancing Trust Through Advanced Web Security

This is a frontend-only prototype for the "User Spend Analysis Dashboard" module. Built with React + Vite.

Quick start (Windows PowerShell):

```powershell
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser.

What's included:
- A modern, responsive dashboard showing spend by category, monthly spend bar chart, and recent transactions.
- Simple SVG charts (no external charting libraries) so you can run the prototype without extra deps.

Next steps:
- Integrate with a backend API for real data, add authentication (OAuth / JWT), and add visualizations using Chart.js or D3.
